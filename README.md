# CollatzConjecture
This code takes a user input for a max integer N and finds the longest such Collatz sequence for i <= N.
The code also prompts user for a given int and will output the Collatz sequence for said integer.

The Collatz Conjecture is an unproven problem in mathematics. Using computational power, the Conjecture seems to be true,
however no formal proof of the conjecture has yet been found.

Collatz Conjecture:
Start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: 
if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. 
If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. 
The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.
